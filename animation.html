                    <p><strong>The Solution</strong><br>Through learning design, I have honed my ability to create
                        visually engaging and user-centric
                        interactive experiences.
                        I’ve gained skills in conceptualizing game ideas, translating sketches into polished visuals,
                        and developing cohesive
                        design systems for games. My understanding of art principles like composition, character design,
                        and UI layout ensures
                        that each design not only captivates users but also enhances their interaction with the game.
                        These experiences have
                        strengthened my creativity, storytelling, and technical design expertise.</p>

                    <h3>01 Concept Development</h3>
                    <p>
                        To create my game The Sushi Game I combined creativity, design principles, and technical
                        expertise.
                        The process began with an exploration of ideas, deeply inspired by illustrations and concepts
                        from
                        Japanese cooking books. These references sparked the initial vision for the game, leading to the
                        development of a unique
                        concept centered around sushi - combining the flat design (similar to looking down at the plate
                        from above) with the fun
                        atmosphere of a running sushi-restaurants.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To bring this idea to life, firstly I did desk research to develop moodboards and style tiles to
                        define the
                        visual direction of the game. Drawing heavily from the artwork of Japanese culinary art, these
                        tools
                        helped create a cohesive style that resonated with the game's theme.

                    <h3>02 Graphic Elements</h3>
                    <p>Developing the graphic design for The Sushi Game was an integral part of creating its unique
                        atmosphere. This phase
                        focused on designing the user interface (UI) and game elements, with particular attention to
                        background design. By
                        employing atmospheric perspective, I was able to create depth and utilize compositional
                        principles such as leading
                        lines, contrasts, focal points, and the rule of thirds to craft visually compelling scenes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For the illustrations, I drew inspiration from flat design styles seen in games like Two Dots
                        and the artwork of Jade
                        Purple Brown. The vibrant and playful color palette, coupled with a fun and engaging font,
                        reinforced the game's
                        energetic and whimsical tone.
                    </p>
                    <p>Additionally, I integrated traditional Japanese illustration motifs, such as Mount Fuji in
                        the background, the iconic red Japanese symbol, and the waving cat, weaving these cultural
                        elements into the UI,
                        background scenes, and game illustrations. These choices helped evoke the perfect atmosphere for
                        the game, striking a
                        balance between modern design and traditional Japanese artistry.</p>

                    <h3>03 Storytelling</h3>
                    <p>For the character design, I focused on leveraging storytelling principles to create engaging and
                        meaningful visuals, inspired by culture - such as the film 'Lost in Translation' and my favorite
                        Japanese
                        restaurant 'Bento' that lies in my neighbourhood.
                        I used shapes and colors to reinforce the
                        personality and role of each
                        element within the game.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The "good" elements were crafted to be colorful and look tasty - as when looking at a menu card
                        -
                        evoking a sense of easy-going and fun vibe, making it simple for players to distinguish them as
                        safe or
                        beneficial through the design.
                    </p>


                    <p>
                        Conversely, the "bad" elements were intentionally designed to be confusing - as if you're a
                        tourist in Tokyo, who does not understand all the signs. By
                        incorporating
                        Japanese letters that are hard to understand (if not Japanese), I created a sense of mystery and
                        challenge,
                        emphasizing their role as
                        conflict within the gameplay.

                        These visual design choices not only enhanced the storytelling but also strengthened the overall
                        theme of the game,
                        blending modern flat design with subtle narrative cues to guide the player's experience.

                    <h3>04 Implementing</h3>
                    <p>To bring the game to life, I combined CSS animations and JavaScript.
                        The process began with planning the game mechanics using a UML activity diagram, which provided
                        a clear overview of the
                        game's flow, logic, and decision points.CSS animations played a significant role in enhancing
                        the visual appeal of the game. Keyframes
                        were used to define
                        smooth transitions and movements, such as floating objects and dynamic interactions triggered by
                        the player.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In JavaScript, I implemented various techniques to handle interactivity and game mechanics.
                        Functions and methods like
                        addClass and removeClass
                        to adjust the visual states of elements based on the player's actions. Variables
                        tracked essential game data, ensuring responsive gameplay.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Event listeners, including load, click, and animationend, were crucial for interactivity. To
                        maintain variety and unpredictability, I used Math.random to generate random positions and
                        sequences for game elements,
                        ensuring that each round felt fresh and challenging.

                        The integration of the UML activity diagram with CSS animations and JavaScript provided a solid
                        foundation for the game,
                        blending design, functionality, and gameplay into a cohesive and enjoyable experience.
